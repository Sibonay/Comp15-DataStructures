# ReadMe for COMP 15 HW4
## Binary Search Tree Assignment

1.  Implementation of a binary search tree

2.  Files:
	- BinarySearchTree.h
	- BinarySearchTree.cpp
	- main.cpp
	- pretty_print.cpp
	- expeced_output.txt
	- Makefile 

3.  Compile using included makefile

4.  Data Structure used:
	- Binary Search Tree (BST)

5.  Outline of algorithm:
	- A class called BinarySearchTree contains the root of the tree (a node)
	  and then functions which help build and modify the Binary Search Tree
	- The BST is composed of Nodes, which are structs that contain: 
		- their data (an integer)
		- their count (how many counts of the same integer there are)
		- a pointer to a left Node (original node's left child)
		- a pointer to a right Node (original node's right child)

6.  Credit:
	- Sam Heilbron (current in comp40) helped me debug some of my functions
	- Suggestion: hire him as a TA! He's so helpful!
