1.	Purpose of program: to model a traditional deck of playing cards 

2.	List of files:
		- card.h - interface of the card class
		- card.cpp - implementation of the card class
		- hand.h - interface of the hand class
		- hand.cpp - implementation of the hard class
		- List_linked_list.h - interface of the List_linked_list class
		- List_linked_list.cpp - implementation of the 
					 List_linked_list class
		- main.cpp 
		- Makefile
		- ReadMe.md
		
3.	How to compile program: use included MakeFile

4.	Data Structure(s) used: C++ linked lists

5.	Outline of Algorithm: uses 3 classes:
		- the Card class defines a playing card: its suit and rank
		- the List_linked_list class stores individual playing cards in
	   	  a singly linked list
		- the Hand class uses our list to produce a Deck or a hand 
		  of cards
