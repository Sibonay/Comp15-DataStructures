1.	Purpose of program: to model a traditional deck of playing cards 
2.	List of files:
		- card.h
		- card.cpp
		- hand.h
		- hand.cpp
		- List_dynamic_array.h
		- List_dynamic_array.cpp
		- main.cpp
		- Makefile
		- ReadMe.md
3.	How to compile program: use included MakeFile
4.	Data Structure(s) used: C++ dynamic arrays
5.	Outline of Algorithm: uses 3 classes:
		- the Card class defines a playing card: its suit and rank
		- the List_dynamic_array class stores individual playing cards
		- the Hand class uses our list to produce a Deck or a hand 
		  of cards
